# HR-ANLYTICAL-DASHBOARD

The dashboard Provides several insightful visuals and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee attrition:

Overall Attrition Rate and Employee Demographics
 Attrition Rate: The attrition rate is shown as 16.12%, which suggests a moderate level of employee turnover.
 Employee Count: There are 1,470 employees, with 237 experiencing attrition.
 Gender Distribution: The workforce is predominantly male (60% male vs. 40% female). This gender distribution is also reflected in attrition, with males accounting for around 63% of those who left.
 
Attrition by Tenure
 The chart "Attrition by Years At Company" shows that employees with less than 1 year of tenure have the highest attrition rate, which sharply declines afterward. This suggests a possible onboarding or early 
 engagement issue, as new employees tend to leave within the first year.
 The trend in attrition based on years at the company could indicate the need for stronger engagement or support during the initial period of employment.
 
Attrition by Job Role and Department
 Job Roles with High Attrition: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the highest attrition rates, while Managers have a comparatively lower rate. This might indicate that these roles have higher 
 job demands or that employees in these roles face unique challenges that lead to turnover.
 Department Distribution: Research & Development has the highest employee count, while Human Resources is the smallest department. These distributions can help HR teams prioritize resources based on 
 department sizes and attrition patterns.
 
Education and Attrition
 The "Attrition by Education Field" chart highlights that employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds have the highest turnover. This insight may prompt further analysis to understand if certain educational backgrounds correlate with specific challenges or if they are predominantly in high-stress roles.
 
Employee Satisfaction and Engagement
 The dashboard includes average satisfaction levels, with the gauge displaying an overall score of 2.73. The satisfaction across different job roles and departments provides a granular view, showing that Sales and Research & Development have slightly higher satisfaction rates than Human Resources. Addressing satisfaction within lower-scoring departments could be essential to reduce turnover.
 
6. Other Key Metrics
 Marital Status and Age Distribution: These demographic breakdowns may provide additional layers for understanding attrition, especially when combined with tenure, satisfaction, and department data. For example, younger employees or single employees might have higher turnover, which could inform targeted engagement strategies.

This dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of HR metrics, focusing on attrition and its relation to various demographic and departmental factors. Key areas for improvement include onboarding support, specific job role engagement (like Laboratory Technicians), and strategies to enhance employee satisfaction. This information could support HR in developing targeted interventions aimed at reducing attrition and improving retention.
